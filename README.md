Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has revolutionized network management by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized control and dynamic network configuration[18]. This thesis explores the semi-automatic generation of SDN using Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the capabilities of LLama3 and GPT3.5 models to enhance the development and management of SDN environments. This begins with a comprehensive overview of SDN, detailing its architecture, benefits and real-world applications. It delves into the programming aspects of SDN, highlighting tools like Mininet for network emulation and the Ryu controller for network management. This section provides practical insights into the integration of these tools, supported by scenarios demonstrating their application in real-world . In the subsequent chapters, the focus shifts to the role of LLMs in automating SDN tasks. The capabilities of LLama3, a state-of-the-art LLM developed by Meta AI, are examined in detail, alongside the GPT3.5 LLM developed by OpenAI, which facilitates the development of LLM-based applications. The thesis investigates how these technologies can be leveraged to automate network tasks, enhance security, and address the challenges posed by traditional SDN approaches.A significant portion of the research is dedicated to the generation of code using LLMs. This includes a detailed analysis of how effective prompts can yield high- quality code, while poorly crafted prompts may result in suboptimal outcomes. Through examples thesis illustrates the potential and limitations of LLM-generated code in SDN environments.The findings suggest that while LLMs offer substantial benefits in terms of automation and efficiency, challenges such as model limitations and ethical considerations must be addressed. The thesis concludes by discussing future directions in the integration of LLMs with SDN, highlighting emerging trends and potential advancements that could further enhance network management and automation. This study adds to the expanding corpus of research on the relationship between artificial intelligence and network management, providing a roadmap for leveraging advanced LLMs to streamline and enhance the development of Software Defined Networks.
